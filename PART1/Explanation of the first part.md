This project focuses on training a model to recognize clothing items and their colors from images. It includes steps for dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, inference, and interpretation. Follow the guide below to understand each part of the process.

## <span style="color:green">1. Training the Dataset</span>

### <span style="color:orange">Load and Preprocess the Dataset</span>
1. **Load and Preprocess**: Begin by loading and preprocessing the dataset. This step includes cleaning the data, resizing images, and applying augmentations to prepare for model training.

### <span style="color:orange">Train a Model</span>
1. **Train Model**: Train a model to detect each clothing item and its color. This can be achieved using techniques such as transfer learning with pre-trained models or by building a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

### <span style="color:orange">Model Architecture</span>
1. **Model Architecture**: Utilize architectures such as modified VGG16 for training. Configure the neural network layers and set up the model to ensure effective learning and prediction capabilities.

## <span style="color:green">2. Apply Different Metrics</span>

### <span style="color:orange">Evaluate the Model</span>
1. **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These metrics help gauge how well the model is performing and identify areas for improvement.

## <span style="color:green">3. Build an Inference System</span>

### <span style="color:orange">Develop Inference Pipeline</span>
1. **Inference Pipeline**: Create a system that takes an input image and outputs the detected item name and its color. This pipeline processes new images through the trained model to produce predictions.

## <span style="color:green">4. Model Interpretation</span>

### <span style="color:orange">Use Interpretation Tools</span>
1. **Model Interpretation**: Employ interpretation tools such as Grad-CAM or SHAP to visualize and understand the model’s decision-making process. These tools help in identifying which parts of the image influence the model’s predictions.
