# Playing Cards Dataset Project

This project involves preprocessing a playing cards dataset, training a model, and building an inference system to recognize cards in images. Below are the detailed steps and instructions for each part of the project.

## 1. Load and Preprocess the Dataset

### Upload Files from Local System to Colab Environment
1. **Upload Files**: Start by uploading the dataset files from your local system to the Google Colab environment. This step is essential to ensure that all necessary files are available for processing and training within the Colab environment.

### Downloading and Extracting Kaggle Dataset
1. **Download Dataset**: Use the Kaggle API to download the dataset directly to the Colab environment. This allows for seamless integration and access to the dataset without manual downloading and uploading.
2. **Extract Files**: Once the dataset is downloaded, extract the files to a specified directory in Colab to prepare for further processing.

### Convert XML Annotations to COCO and YOLO Formats
1. **Convert Annotations**: Convert XML annotations to COCO and YOLO formats manually. This step involves parsing XML files to extract annotation details and then formatting them according to the COCO and YOLO standards. This ensures compatibility with different machine learning frameworks and models.

### Apply Augmentations to Images Using Albumentations
1. **Augment Images**: Use the Albumentations library to apply augmentations to the images. Augmentation techniques such as rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments help enhance the dataset by introducing variability, which improves the robustness of the trained model.

## 2. Train the Model

### Generate data.yaml Configuration File for YOLO
1. **Create Configuration File**: Generate a `data.yaml` file required for YOLO training. This file specifies paths to the training and validation datasets, the number of classes, and the class names. It acts as a configuration guide for the YOLO training process.

### Train YOLO Model with Custom Dataset
1. **Train Model**: Use the YOLO framework to train the model with the custom playing cards dataset. This involves specifying training parameters such as image size, batch size, number of epochs, and the path to the dataset configuration file. The training process will iteratively improve the model's accuracy in recognizing and classifying playing cards.

## 3. Perform Object Detection on Uploaded Image Using YOLO

### Inference Pipeline
1. **Develop Inference Pipeline**: Create a pipeline to perform object detection on uploaded images. This pipeline will take an input image, run the trained YOLO model to detect and classify the cards, and then output the recognized card details. It ensures that the model can be used for real-time or batch image processing.

### Option to Plot Output
1. **Plot Option**: Provide an option to plot the output based on user preference. This allows users to visually verify the detection results. If the plotting option is enabled, the detected cards and their bounding boxes will be displayed on the image. If disabled, the detection results will be saved or printed without visualization.
