To ensure a clean and visually appealing presentation, follow these steps to format and resize the images:

1. **Resize Images**: Ensure all images have the same dimensions. You can use an image editor or a script to resize them to a common size. A standard size like 400x400 pixels often works well for presentation purposes.

2. **Arrange Images**: Position images in a grid or a single row, depending on how many you have and the layout you prefer.

3. **Align Text and Links**: Make sure that text and links are aligned properly with the images for a cohesive look.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might format the content with resized images and consistent layout:
