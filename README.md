# Project Overview

This repository contains two main branches, each focusing on different aspects of the project. The branches are:

1. **Core Development**: Includes core development tasks, model training, and pipeline creation.
2. **Testing and Deployment**: Contains testing scripts and deployment configurations.

## Part 1: Apparel Images Dataset

**Dataset Link**: [Apparel Images Dataset](#)

### Tasks

1. **Training the Dataset**:
    - Load and preprocess the dataset.
    - Train a model to detect each item of clothing and its color using techniques such as transfer learning or building a custom CNN.

2. **Apply Different Metrics**:
    - Evaluate the model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

3. **Build an Inference System**:
    - Develop an inference pipeline that takes an input image and outputs the detected item name and its color.

4. **Model Interpretation**:
    - Use model interpretation tools such as Grad-CAM or SHAP to visualize and understand the model's decision-making process.

## Part 2: Playing Cards Dataset

**Dataset Link**: [Playing Cards Dataset](#)

### Tasks

1. **Preprocess the Dataset**:
    - Perform data preprocessing tasks such as resizing and changing the dataset format (YOLO, COCO, etc.) manually (without using Roboflow).

2. **Train the Model**:
    - Develop a model that can recognize and classify playing cards.

3. **Build an Inference System**:
    - Provide an option to plot the output based on user preference.
